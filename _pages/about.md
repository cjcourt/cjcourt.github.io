# About me
Thanks for taking the time to stop by my site, hopefully you'll find something interesting to read, from my previous [publications](publications/), various [projects I have worked on](projects/), a (small) list of [blog posts](year-archive/) and my [CV](cv/).

As you might have gathered by now, I am currently a final-year PhD Student in the Molecular Engineering Group at the University of Cambridge. My research has focussed on the application of natural language processing, data-science and machine learning to the discovery of novel magnetic materials.

<i>"Hang-on."</i> I hear you say, <i>"How on Earth does natural language processing help you discover new materials?"</i>. Well, that's a very interesting question, thanks for asking. I actually have written an extensive [blog post](/posts/2020/09/NLP_Mat_sci/) outlining just that.

Outside of my PhD work, I am a machine learning enthusiast, a pole vaulter, a keen runner and occasional guitar player. I'm sure all of these topics will get some air-time on this site eventually, so stay tuned!

Cheers.

Callum
