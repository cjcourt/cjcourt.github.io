excerpt: 'Predicting the properties of materials prior to their synthesis is of great importance in materials science. Magnetic and superconducting materials exhibit a number of unique properties that make them useful in a wide variety of applications, including solid oxide fuel cells, solid-state refrigerants, photon detectors and metrology devices. In all these applications, phase transitions play an important role in determining the feasibility of the materials in question. Here, we present a pipeline for fully integrating data extracted from the scientific literature into machine-learning tools for property prediction and materials discovery. Using advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine-learning techniques, we successfully reconstruct the phase diagrams of well-known magnetic and superconducting compounds, and demonstrate that it is possible to predict the phase-transition temperatures of compounds not present in the database. We provide the tool as an online open-source platform, forming the basis for further research into magnetic and superconducting materials discovery for potential device applications.'

# Description
![TOC](/images/npj_toc.png)
This paper utilises text-mining and machine learning to automatially reconstruct the magnetic and superconducting phase diagrams of known materials. It further demonstrates how basic material descriptors can be used with regression models to predict the phase transitions of compounds not present in the database.
